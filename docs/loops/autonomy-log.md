# Autonomy log

Append-only journal of autonomous runs. Newest first. Each entry: what was decided and
why, what shipped, what was challenged by subagents, what was deferred to a human. Governed
by the charter in [`07-autonomy.md`](07-autonomy.md).

## 2026-06-08 - Bootstrap autonomy

**Context.** Operator switched the repo to a full-autonomy experiment: improve the product
continuously, no per-change approval, self-challenge with subagents, keep a rollback point.

**Decided / shipped.**
- Tagged rollback baseline `autonomy-baseline-2026-06-08` on `main` (post #6/#7 merge) and
  pushed it. Restore with `git checkout autonomy-baseline-2026-06-08`.
- Wrote the autonomy charter (`07-autonomy.md`): mandate, hard guardrails, the
  stop-and-leave-for-human list, the subagent challenge protocol, budgets, this journal.
- Allowed `git tag *` in `.claude/settings.json` so future runs can re-baseline.

**Earlier this session (pre-charter, for the record).**
- Built the end-to-end loop system (PR #9, open): `triage`, `ship-pr`, `write-up` skills +
  `docs/loops/03-06`.
- `implement-issue` produced PR #7 (CHANGELOG); `ship-pr` was dogfooded live and merged #7
  and #6 (closing issues #3 and #2) on green CI.

**Challenged.** Not yet - subagent review protocol starts with the next product change.

**Deferred to human.** None.

**Next.** Merge #9 once green; then work the backlog (#4 seed catalog, #5 empty states,
#1 imperial units), each subagent-challenged before merge per the protocol.
